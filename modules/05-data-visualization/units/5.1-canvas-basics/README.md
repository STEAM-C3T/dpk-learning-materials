## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Create** an HTML5 Canvas element and obtain its 2D rendering context.
2. **Draw** basic shapes (rectangles, lines, text) on the canvas.
3. **Scale** data values to fit visual dimensions.
4. **Build** an accessible bar chart with companion table.
5. **Add** interactivity to visualizations using mouse events.

## Overview

Unit 5.1 introduces students to the HTML5 Canvas API for creating custom data visualizations. Students will:

- Set up a canvas element and context
- Learn coordinate systems and drawing methods
- Apply scaling formulas to convert data into pixel positions
- Render bar charts with labels and hover effects
- Provide accessible alternatives (companion tables, text descriptions)

**Estimated Time:** 90–120 minutes
