# Module 04: JavaScript Essentials

Digital Proficiency Kit
Web Development for STEAM

---

## Purpose & Placement

- Builds on: Module 03 — CSS Styling & Layout
- Leads to: Module 05 — Data Visualization
- Duration: 2–3 hours

**Key Artefacts:**

- Interactive counter/toggle
- Dynamic to-do list or similar UI

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Write basic JavaScript for DOM manipulation
- Handle events and update content
- Manage simple UI state
- Apply progressive enhancement

---

## Teacher Focus Points

- Unit 4.1: 45–60 min
- Unit 4.2: 45–75 min
- Projects: 30–45 min
- Common misconceptions: DOM vs. HTML; state vs. presentation
- Accessibility: Keyboard operability, focus management

---

## Big Ideas

- JavaScript adds interactivity
- DOM is the live document structure
- State drives UI rendering

```
User Event → JS Updates State → Render to DOM

## Vocabulary

| Term           | Example                  |

Glossary: See module README

## Demonstration

See tutorial for step-by-step: Build an interactive counter with accessible updates

---

## Guided Practice

Add event listeners to create interactive elements (see tutorial for details)

---

## Independent Project

Build a dynamic UI component (to-do list, toggle, etc.) using state and rendering (see workbook for requirements)

---

## Assessment Criteria

- Functionality (interaction works)
- State management
- Accessibility (keyboard operable)
- Progressive enhancement
- Reflection

See Teacher Toolkit for full rubric

---

## Accessibility

- Use semantic buttons
- Ensure keyboard operability
- Provide visible feedback
- Manage focus when adding/removing elements

---

## Extension

- Add filtering or search
- Implement localStorage persistence
- Create multi-step forms with validation

---

## Reflection

How does JavaScript change user experience? What's challenging about state management?
