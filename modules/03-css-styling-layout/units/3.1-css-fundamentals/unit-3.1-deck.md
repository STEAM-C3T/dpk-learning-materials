# Unit 3.1: CSS Fundamentals

Module 03: CSS Styling & Layout
Digital Proficiency Kit

---

## Warm-Up

What makes a website look professional? What visual elements do you notice first?

_Think, pair, share your ideas._

---

## Unit Objectives

- Apply CSS selectors and properties
- Control typography and colors
- Understand the box model (margin, padding, border)
- Create visual hierarchy

---

## Quick Check

What's the difference between HTML and CSS? Why separate them?

---

## CSS Selectors

- Element: `h1 { }`
- Class: `.classname { }`
- ID: `#idname { }`

Target specific elements to apply styles

---

## Typography

- `font-family`: Choose fonts
- `font-size`: Text size
- `line-height`: Line spacing
- `font-weight`: Bold, normal

---

## Colors

- Named: `color: blue;`
- Hex: `color: #0000ff;`
- RGB: `color: rgb(0, 0, 255);`
- HSL: `color: hsl(240, 100%, 50%);`

---

## Box Model

Every element is a box:

- Content
- Padding (inside spacing)
- Border
- Margin (outside spacing)

---

## Guided Practice

Add CSS to style headings, paragraphs, and create visual hierarchy

---

## Check for Understanding

1. What selector targets a class?
2. What's the difference between padding and margin?
3. How do you change text color?

---

## Independent Task

Style your content page with typography and colors

---

## Reflection

Which CSS properties were most effective? What was challenging?

---

## Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- Use relative units for text sizing

---

## Extension

- Try different font combinations
- Create a color palette
- Experiment with text shadows
