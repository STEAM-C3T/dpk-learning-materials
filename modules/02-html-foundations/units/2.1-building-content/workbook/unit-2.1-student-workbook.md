# Student Workbook: Unit 2.1 — Building Content

**Module:** 02 — HTML Foundations  
**Unit:** 2.1 — Building Content  
**Name:** ****************\_\_\_****************  
**Date:** ****************\_\_\_****************

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, I will be able to:

- [ ] Create a clear heading hierarchy using `<h1>` through `<h6>`
- [ ] Structure text content using paragraphs and line breaks appropriately
- [ ] Build ordered and unordered lists
- [ ] Add descriptive links with meaningful link text
- [ ] Insert images with appropriate alt text for accessibility

---

## Key Concepts

**Fill in the blanks as you progress through the tutorial:**

1. The `<h1>` element should be used ****\_\_**** per page for the main title.

2. Headings create a ****\_\_**** that helps screen readers navigate.

3. Use `<ul>` for ****\_\_**** lists and `<ol>` for ****\_\_**** lists.

4. The `href` attribute in an `<a>` tag specifies the ****\_\_****.

5. Alt text for images should ****\_\_**** what's in the image.

6. Link text should be ****\_\_**** and make sense out of context.

## Guided Practice Notes

### Part 1: Heading Hierarchy

**My chosen topic:** ****************\_\_\_****************

**My heading structure:**

```
<h1>: ___________________________________

<h2>: ___________________________________
<h2>: ___________________________________
<h2>: ___________________________________

<h3> (under second h2): ___________________________________
<h3> (under second h2): ___________________________________
```

**Question:** Why shouldn't I skip from `<h1>` to `<h3>`?

---

---

---

### Part 2: Lists

**When I should use `<ul>`:**

---

---

**When I should use `<ol>`:**

---

---

**My list examples:**

Unordered list items:

- ***
- ***
- ***

Ordered list items:

1. ***
2. ***
3. ***

---

### Part 3: Links

**My external links (with descriptive text):**

| Link Text  | URL    |
| ---------- | ------ |
| ****\_**** | \_\_\_ |
| ****\_**** | \_\_\_ |

**Why "click here" is bad link text:**

---

---

### Part 4: Images

**My images:**

| Image Filename   | Alt Text     |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| ******\_\_****** | **\_\_\_\_** |
| ******\_\_****** | **\_\_\_\_** |
| ******\_\_****** | **\_\_\_\_** |

**Question:** What should alt text be for a decorative image?

## Independent Task Checklist

**Task:** Create a content page about a topic you're passionate about.

- [ ] At least 3 `<h2>` section headings
- [ ] At least 2 `<h3>` subsection headings
- [ ] Minimum 5 paragraphs with meaningful content
- [ ] One unordered list with at least 3 items
- [ ] One ordered list with at least 3 items

---

## Formative Checks

**Check 1: After Step 2 (Headings)**

- [ ] My headings follow logical order
- [ ] I have only one `<h1>`
- [ ] I didn't skip heading levels
- [ ] Headings decrease in size appropriately

**Check 2: After Step 4 (Lists)**

- [ ] All list items wrapped in `<li>` tags
- [ ] List items are inside `<ul>` or `<ol>`
- [ ] Used correct list type for content

**Check 3: After Step 5 (Links)**

- [ ] All links have `href` attribute
- [ ] Link text is descriptive
- [ ] Links work when clicked

**Check 4: After Step 6 (Images)**

- [ ] All images have `alt` attribute
- [ ] Alt text describes image content
- [ ] Images display correctly

## Self-Assessment Rubric

Rate yourself on each criterion (1 = Beginning, 2 = Developing, 3 = Proficient, 4 = Exemplary):
