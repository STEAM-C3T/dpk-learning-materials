# Unit 2.1: Building Content

Module 02: HTML Foundations
Digital Proficiency Kit

---

## Warm-Up

What makes a webpage easy to understand? What elements help you find information quickly?

_Think, pair, share your ideas._

---

## Unit Objectives

- Use headings to create clear hierarchy
- Add paragraphs, lists, and links effectively
- Include images with descriptive alt text
- Structure content semantically

---

## Quick Check

What's the difference between `<h1>` and `<h2>`? Why does heading order matter?

---

## Headings & Hierarchy

- `<h1>`: Main page title (one per page)
- `<h2>`: Major sections
- `<h3>`: Subsections
- Don't skip levels

---

## Paragraphs & Lists

- `<p>`: Paragraphs for text blocks
- `<ul>`: Unordered lists (bullets)
- `<ol>`: Ordered lists (numbered)
- `<li>`: List items

---

## Links

- `<a href="url">Link text</a>`
- Use descriptive text ("Read the tutorial" not "click here")
- Links open in same window by default

---

## Images

- `<img src="path" alt="description">`
- Alt text describes image content
- Essential for screen readers

Example:

```html
<img src="cat.jpg" alt="Orange cat sleeping on windowsill" />
```

---

## Guided Practice

Create a topic page with:

- One `<h1>` heading
- Two `<h2>` section headings
- Paragraphs and a list
- One image with alt text

---

## Check for Understanding

1. What tag creates a bulleted list?
2. Why is alt text important?
3. What makes good link text?

---

## Independent Task

Build a content page about your hobby or interest using headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images

---

## Reflection

Which HTML element was easiest to use? Which was most challenging?

---

## Accessibility

- Headings create document outline
- Alt text describes images for screen readers
- Link text should make sense out of context

---

## Extension

- Add a navigation menu with links
- Use nested lists
- Include multiple images with captions

---
