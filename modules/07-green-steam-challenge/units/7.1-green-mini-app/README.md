## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Define** a narrow, achievable scope for a sustainability-focused web application.
2. **Implement** semantic HTML structure with accessibility features (ARIA, landmarks).
3. **Use** JavaScript to manage application state and localStorage persistence.
4. **Communicate** ethical considerations transparently (privacy, impact limitations).
5. **Test** for accessibility using keyboard navigation and basic screen reader simulation.

## Overview

Unit 7.1 challenges students to create a small, purpose-driven mini‑app aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Students will:

- Choose a focused sustainability theme (e.g., habit tracking, awareness tool)
- Write a user story and wireframe the interface
- Build a semantic HTML skeleton with privacy disclosures
- Implement JavaScript state management and localStorage persistence
- Ensure ethical transparency (honest impact claims, no greenwashing)
- Test for accessibility and reflect on design decisions

**Estimated Time:** 120–180 minutes (can be split across 2–3 sessions)
