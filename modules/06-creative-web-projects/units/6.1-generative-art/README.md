## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Use** `requestAnimationFrame` to create smooth animation loops.
2. **Apply** randomness and transformation (translate, rotate, scale) for generative effects.
3. **Build** a particle system with dynamic movement.
4. **Add** UI controls (sliders) to adjust visual parameters.
5. **Implement** pause/play controls for accessibility.

## Overview

Unit 6.1 explores generative art—visuals created through code and algorithmic processes. Students will:

- Set up continuous animation loops
- Use randomness to create varied visual outcomes
- Implement particles with position, velocity, and lifecycle
- Connect HTML range inputs to visual parameters
- Ensure animations can be paused for accessibility

**Estimated Time:** 90–120 minutes
