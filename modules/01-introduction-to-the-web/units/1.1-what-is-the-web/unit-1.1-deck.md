# Unit 1.1: What Is the Web?

Module 01: Introduction to the Web

---

## Warm-Up

**Prompt:**
What happens when you type a website address and press Enter?

_Think, pair, share your ideas._

---

## Unit Objectives

- Explain the difference between the internet and the web
- Describe clients, servers, and browsers
- Identify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

## Quick Check

What is a URL?

Why does it matter to know how browsers display web pages?

---

## Internet vs. Web

- **Internet:** Global network of computers
- **Web:** Linked documents accessed by browsers

**Analogy:**
Internet = roads; Web = cars on the roads

---

## Client-Server Model

- **Client:** Your browser (requests pages)
- **Server:** Stores and sends webpages

**How it works:**

1. Type a URL
2. Browser requests page
3. Server responds with files
4. Browser displays page

---

## What Is a Browser?

- Software that displays web content
- Examples: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

---

## The Big Three: HTML, CSS, JS

- **HTML:** Structure
- **CSS:** Style
- **JavaScript:** Interactivity

**Analogy:**
HTML = skeleton, CSS = skin, JS = movement

---

## Live Demo

See how HTML, CSS, and JS work together:

- Inspect a simple webpage
- Find HTML, CSS, and JS in DevTools

---

## Guided Practice

Draw the client-server model:

- Client → Server (Request)
- Server → Client (Response)
- Add "User" typing a URL

---

## Check for Understanding

1. Internet vs. web?
2. Name HTML, CSS, JS roles
3. True/False: Browser stores webpages permanently

---

## Independent Task

Research and explain one web technology (HTML, CSS, or JS). Write a short paragraph and give an example.

---

## Reflection

What surprised you? What questions do you have? How does this change your view of websites?

---

## Accessibility

Semantic HTML tags (like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`) help screen readers. We'll use them in Unit 1.2.

---

## Extension

Early finishers: Read [MDN: How the Web Works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) or inspect your favorite website in DevTools.
