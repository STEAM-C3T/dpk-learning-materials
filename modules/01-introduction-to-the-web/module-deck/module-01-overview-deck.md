# Module 01: Introduction to the Web

Digital Proficiency Kit
Web Development for STEAM

---

## Purpose & Placement

- Builds on: None (foundational)
- Leads to: Module 02 — HTML Foundations
- Duration: 3–4 hours

**Key Artefacts:**

- "About Me" webpage
- Simple web explanation page

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- This is the entry point to web development; no prior experience required.
- Emphasize that students will be creating real, working web pages by the end.
- Timing: 2 minutes.
-->

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Explain how the web works
- Identify basic HTML structure
- Create a simple webpage with semantic tags
- Describe HTML, CSS, JS roles

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Read outcomes aloud; students can highlight in their workbooks.
- Ask: "Who has ever wondered how websites are made?"
- Timing: 3 minutes.
-->

---

## Teacher Focus Points

- Unit 1.1: 60–90 min
- Unit 1.2: 90–120 min
- Projects: 60 min
- Common misconceptions: Web ≠ Internet; HTML ≠ programming
- Accessibility: Use semantic tags, alt text

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Be transparent about time requirements; adjust pacing based on student readiness.
- Pre-address misconceptions during Unit 1.1 introduction.
-->

---

## Big Ideas

- The web links documents (HTML)
- Browsers interpret code (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Semantic structure matters

Diagram:

```
Client ↔ Internet ↔ Server
   ↓
Renders: HTML + CSS + JS
```

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Use the diagram on screen; draw it on board if possible.
- Analogy: "HTML is like the frame of a house; CSS is paint and decoration; JS is electricity and plumbing."
- Timing: 5 minutes.
-->

## Vocabulary

| Term       | Example          |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| HTML       | `<h1>Title</h1>` |
| CSS        | `color: blue;`   |
| JavaScript | `alert('Hi!')`   |
| Tag        | `<p>`, `</p>`    |
| Semantic   | `<header>`       |
| Browser    | Chrome, Firefox  |

Glossary: See module README

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Students copy these into workbooks or refer to handout.
- Use terms consistently throughout all lessons.
- Quiz verbally: "What does CSS do?"
-->

---

## Demonstration

See tutorial for step-by-step: Build a "Hello, Web!" page

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Code live; avoid copy-pasting to model process.
- Make an intentional typo (e.g., forget closing tag) and debug aloud.
- Ask: "What do you predict will happen when I open this in the browser?"
- Timing: 10–12 minutes.
-->

---

## Guided Practice

Create "My First Webpage" (see tutorial for details)

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Provide a template on screen or handout for students who need scaffolding.
- Check 2–3 student files live to ensure correct structure.
- Timing: 15 minutes including setup.
-->

---

## Independent Project

"About Me" webpage using semantic HTML (see workbook for requirements)

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Show exemplar from previous class (anonymized) if available.
- Emphasize creativity: students can personalize content freely.
- Offer simplified version (fewer tags) for struggling students; advanced version (add links) for early finishers.
- Timing: Allocate 1 hour of class time or assign as homework.
-->

---

## Assessment Criteria

- Functionality
- Semantic structure
- Accessibility
- Creativity
- Reflection

See Teacher Toolkit for full rubric

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Share rubric with students before they start project.
- Use peer review: students check each other's work against criteria.
- Collect and assess using rubric; provide written feedback.
-->

---

## Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML tags
- Add alt text to images

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Demonstrate a Lighthouse audit live.
- Share story: "Imagine navigating a webpage without seeing it — how would semantic tags help?"
- Timing: 3 minutes.
-->

---

## Extension

- Add a nav section
- Try nested lists
- Use <figure> and <figcaption>

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Post extension activities on board or LMS at start of session.
- Encourage early finishers to help peers (peer mentoring).
-->

---

## Reflection

What surprised you? What tag are you confident with? How could you use a personal webpage?

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Collect exit tickets (paper or digital form) at end of final session.
- Review responses to identify common struggles or misconceptions.
- Celebrate creative applications students imagine.
- Timing: 5 minutes.
-->

## Next Module Preview

Module 02 — HTML Foundations
More tags, attributes, and multi-section pages

<!-- Speaker Notes:
- Build anticipation: "You'll create more complex, real-world pages."
- Assign optional exploration task: "Screenshot a website and label the HTML elements you think it uses."
-->
